# Hey! I'm Dak. ðŸ‘‹
### A self-motivated Software Engineer with a passion for understanding and always learning.

**Current Position:** Founding Software Engineer at [Dunbar](https://trydunbar.com).

Find me on social media like **[X/Twitter](https://fromdak.to/x)**, **[LinkedIn](https://fromdak.to/linkedin)**, **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dakdevs/)**.

On the side I play PvP games like **[Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/)**, **[Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)**, and **[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/)**. In a past life I played **[Aion Online](https://www.aiononline.com/)** religiously as well. I actually used to run a site from 2009-2014 called PvP All Day that archived, showcased, and selectively featured video content made by other players on Aion. Now since the Aion team has created a Classic version of the game, I have been working on reviving **[PvP All Day](https://pvpallday.com)**!

I've been creating solutions and expanding my knowledge on technology since my dad sat me down at a computer at age 5 playing with Visual Basic! Since then I have been lucky enough to learn many awesome concepts and languages like **PHP**, **JavaScript/NodeJS/TypeScript**, **Python**, **Golang**, and many more.

It has been quite an experience constantly learning efficient ways to deliver and maintain high quality tech solutions and infrastructure. My interest truly never ends and I will never stop learning through technology as well as from those I'm lucky enough to be around.
