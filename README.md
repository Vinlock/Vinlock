# Hey! I'm Dak. ðŸ‘‹
### A self-motivated Software Engineer with a passion for understanding and always learning.

Find me on social media like **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vinlockz)**, **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dwashbrook)**, **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vinlockz/)**.

On the side I play PvP games like **[Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/)**, **[Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)**, and **[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/)**. In a past life I played **[Aion Online](https://www.aiononline.com/)** religiously as well. I actually used to run a site from 2009-2014 called PvP All Day that archived, showcased, and selectively featured video content made by other players on Aion.

I've been creating solutions and expanding my knowledge on technology since my dad sat me down at a computer at age 5 playing with Visual Basic! Since then I have been lucky enough to learn many awesome concepts and languages like **PHP**, **JavaScript/NodeJS/TypeScript**, **Python**, **Golang**, and many more.

It has been quite an experience constantly learning efficient ways to deliver and maintain high quality tech solutions and infrastructure. My interest truly never ends and I will never stop learning through technology as well as from those I'm lucky enough to be around.

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer with the awesome Retail team at **[Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com)**, working on a **[Point of Sale system](https://weedmaps.com/business/retail/)** for the Cannbis industry. Places I have previously worked include **[NCSOFT](https://ncsoft.com)** and **[Dellamoda](https://dellamoda.com)**.
